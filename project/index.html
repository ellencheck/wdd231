      <h2>About Ellen Check Language School</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ellen Check Language School</strong> offers high-quality language education where all instructors are <strong>native speakers</strong>.  
        You can learn multiple languages including: <strong>Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Language Levels</h3>
      <p>
        Courses are structured from beginner to advanced levels: A1 → B1 → C1 → C2.  
        All other languages follow the same level structure.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Teaching Method</h3>
      <p>
        Our school focuses on <strong>practical learning</strong> rather than memorization of words and grammar.  
        Students study grammar, vocabulary, and video lessons independently, then practice actively with native speaker instructors during lessons.  
        This ensures immediate application of knowledge in real conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every teacher is a <strong>native speaker</strong>, combining correct pronunciation, real-life communication, and professional pedagogical techniques.  
        This approach guarantees that students learn languages authentically and effectively.
