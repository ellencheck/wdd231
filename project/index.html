      <h2>About Ellen Chek Language School</h2>
      <p>

        We offer courses in: <strong>Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese</strong>.

      <h3>Language Levels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginner (A1)</li>
        <li>Intermediate (B1)</li>
        <li>Advanced (C1)</li>

      <h3>Our Teaching Method</h3>
      <p>
        Our courses focus on <strong>practical learning</strong>, not just memorizing vocabulary and grammar.  
        You study grammar, vocabulary, and video lessons independently, then practice with teachers during lessons.  
        This method allows you to apply what you learned immediately in conversation and exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        All lessons are taught by <strong>native speakers and qualified language instructors</strong>, combining correct pronunciation, live communication, and professional teaching methods.
      </p>
